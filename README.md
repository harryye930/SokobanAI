# SokobanAI
Implemented a intelligent solver for the puzzle game Soloban by implementing a number of search algorithms (A*, weighted A*, Iterative A*) and hustritic functions (manhattan distance, self-build heuristic). Result in a  better performance compared to the given implementation, and be able to solve most of the tricky boards.
